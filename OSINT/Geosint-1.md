## Solution

I opened up the level and immediately spotted the World Trade Center and the Statue of Liberty
in the distance, which means we're in or around New York City. I'm not super familiar with
New York myself, so I used Google Street View to scour areas where water was to the west,
land was to the east, and both the World Trade Center and the Statue were barely visible to the
north. After some trial and error, I ended up on Shore Pkwy near Bobby Bello Field in Bay Ridge,
Brooklyn.
