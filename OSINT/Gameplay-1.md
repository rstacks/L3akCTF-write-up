# Gameplay-1

## Description

When me and my friend aren't duoing CTFs, we like to play video games together. We left a trail of flags in the wake of our gaming antics, can you find them all? Here's a clue to start you off: mch4cker1337

## Solution

We are given the clue "mch4cker1337." After Googling this, I found my way to a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8B0tS_wcIo)
called "Pro Minecraft Gameplay." Throughout the almost
2 and a half hour video, the player mch4cker1337 sends messages in the in-game chat. By combining
his messages together in the order they appear, we are able to construct the flag.
