We are given the clue "mch4cker1337." After Googling this, I found my way to a YouTube video
called "Pro Minecraft Gameplay" at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8B0tS_wcIo. Throughout the almost
2 and a half hour video, the player mch4cker1337 sends messages in the in-game chat. By combining
his messages together in the order they appear, we are left with the flag.
