Stuck on this one, too. I can tell that there is an RSA encryption happening here, but
I'm not sure how to successfully decrypt the flag with the information given. My thought was
that I need to somehow find the prime factors p and q of n (which is provided), but n is too large
for this be done without the help of an algorithm.
