# L3akCTF 2024 Writeup

[L3akCTF 2024](https://ctf.l3ak.team/) was a 48 hour competition that ran from 5/24/2024 to 5/26/2024. This was my first CTF competition, and while I wasn't able to complete many
challenges, I still had a great time and learned some very useful skills.

Below are my solutions to the challenges I managed to complete. I've also included writeups on my progress and thought process for challenges I attempted, but was not able to complete. If you're
curious about my results in the competition, that information is also below.
